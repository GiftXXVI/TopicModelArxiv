      "['This is a response to the commentaries on \"CoRR: A Computing Research\\nRepository\".', 'We describe the Computing Research Repository (CoRR), a new electronic\\narchive for rapid dissemination and archiving of computer science research\\nresults. CoRR was initiated in September 1998 through the cooperation of ACM,\\nLANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) e-Print archive, and NCSTRL (Networked\\nComputer Science Technical Research Library. Through its implementation of the\\nDienst protocol, CoRR combines the open and extensible architecture of NCSTRL\\nwith the reliable access and well-established management practices of the LANL\\nXXX e-Print repository. This architecture will allow integration with other\\ne-Print archives and provides a foundation for a future broad-based scholarly\\ndigital library. We describe the decisions that were made in creating CoRR, the\\narchitecture of the CoRR/NCSTRL interoperation, and issues that have arisen\\nduring the operation of CoRR.', 'PURPOSE: Clinical examinations are performed on the basis of necessity.\\nHowever, our decisions to investigate and document are influenced by various\\nother factors, such as workload and preconceptions. Data missingness patterns\\nmay contain insights into conscious and unconscious norms of clinical practice.\\nMETHODS: We examine data from the SPOTLIGHT study, a multi-centre cohort study\\nof the effect of prompt ICU admission on mortality. We identify missing values\\nand generate an auxiliary dataset indicating the missing entries. We deploy\\nsparse Gaussian Graphical modelling techniques to identify conditional\\ndependencies between the observed data and missingness patterns. We quantify\\nthese associations with sparse partial correlation, correcting for multiple\\ncollinearity. RESULTS: We identify 35 variables which significantly influence\\ndata missingness patterns (alpha = 0.01). We identify reduced recording of\\nessential monitoring such as temperature (partial corr. = -0.0542, p =\\n6.65e-10), respiratory rate (partial corr. = -0.0437, p = 5.15e-07) and urea\\n(partial corr. = -0.0263, p = 0.001611) in patients with reduced consciousness.\\nWe demonstrate reduction of temperature (partial corr. = -0.04, p = 8.5e-06),\\nurine output (partial corr. = -0.05, p = 7.5e-09), lactate (partial corr. =\\n-0.03, p = 0.00032) and bilirubin (partial corr. = -0.03, p = 0.00137)\\nmonitoring due to winter pressures. We provide statistical evidence of Missing\\nNot at Random patterns in FiO2 and SF ratio recording. CONCLUSIONS: Graphical\\nmissingness analysis offers valuable insights into critical care delivery,\\nidentifying specific areas for quality improvement.', \"Based on an empirical analysis of author usage of CoRR, and of its\\npredecessor in the Los Alamos eprint archives, it is shown that CoRR has not\\nyet been able to match the early growth of the Los Alamos physics archives.\\nSome of the reasons are implicit in Halpern's paper, and we explore them\\nfurther here. In particular we refer to the need to promote CoRR more\\neffectively for its intended community - computer scientists in universities,\\nindustrial research labs and in government. We take up some points of detail on\\nthis new world of open archiving concerning central versus distributed\\nself-archiving, publication, the restructuring of the journal publishers'\\nniche, peer review and copyright.\", 'Discusses how CoRR was set up and some policy issues involved with setting up\\nsuch a repository.', 'In constructive recognition of a representation of a Classical group $G$,\\nmuch attention has been paid to the natural representation as well as to\\ngeneric (Black Box) algorithms that treat all representations uniformly. There\\nare theoretical and practical improvements to be made by giving special\\ntreatment to certain non-natural representations that arise frequently. In this\\npaper we present and analyse a Las Vegas algorithm for rewriting the Symmetric\\nSquare representation.', \"The systems supporting signal and image applications process large amount of\\ndata. That involves an intensive use of the memory which becomes the bottleneck\\nof systems. Memory limits performances and represents a significant proportion\\nof total consumption. In the development high level synthesis tool called GAUT\\nLow Power, we are interested in the synthesis of the memory unit. In this work,\\nwe integrate the data storage and data transfert to constraint the high level\\nsynthesis of the datapath's execution unit.\", 'We introduce a new approach to take into account the memory architecture and\\nthe memory mapping in High- Level Synthesis for data intensive applications. We\\nformalize the memory mapping as a set of constraints for the synthesis, and\\ndefined a Memory Constraint Graph and an accessibility criterion to be used in\\nthe scheduling step. We use a memory mapping file to include those memory\\nconstraints in our HLS tool GAUT. It is possible, with the help of GAUT, to\\nexplore a wide range of solutions, and to reach a good tradeoff between time,\\npower-consumption, and area.', 'We introduce a new approach to take into account the memory architecture and\\nthe memory mapping in the High- Level Synthesis of Real-Time embedded systems.\\nWe formalize the memory mapping as a set of constraints used in the scheduling\\nstep. We use a memory mapping file to include those memory constraints in our\\nHLS tool GAUT. Our scheduling algorithm exhibits a relatively low complexity\\nthat permits to tackle complex designs in a reasonable time. Finally, we show\\nhow to explore, with the help of GAUT, a wide range of solutions, and to reach\\na good tradeoff between time, power-consumption, and area.', \"Primary Cyclic matrices were used (but not named) by Holt and Rees in their\\nversion of Parker's MEAT-AXE algorithm to test irreducibility of finite matrix\\ngroups and algebras. They are matrices $X$ with at least one cyclic component\\nin the primary decomposition of the underlying vector space as an $X$-module.\\nLet $\\\\operatorname{M}(c,q^b)$ be an irreducible subalgebra of\\n$\\\\operatorname{M}(n,q)$, where $n=bc >c$. We prove a generalisation of the\\nKung-Stong Cycle Index, and use it to obtain a lower bound for the proportion\\nof primary cyclic matrices in $\\\\operatorname{M}(c,q^b)$.

An autocorrelation function Corr(Delta t) = <TS(t) TS(t+Delta t)> was\\nthen calculated, and averaged over all patients. Positive Corr(Delta t)\\nindicates that TS at a given hour and Delta t hours later are similar. TO was\\ntreated likewise. Simulations and mathematical analysis showed that circadian\\nrhythm required Corr(Delta t) to have a U-shape consisting of positive values\\nnear Delta t=0 and 23, and negative values for intermediate Delta t.\\nSignificant deviation of Corr(Delta t) from the correlator function of pure\\nnoise was evaluated as a chi-squared value.\\n  Results: Circadian patterns were not apparent in hourly averages of TS and TO\\nplotted against clock time, which had large error bars. Their correlator\\nfunctions, however, produced chi-squared values of ~10 in CAST (both p<0.0001)\\nand ~3 in ISAR (both p<0.0001), indicating presence of circadian rhythmicity.\\n  Conclusion: Correlator functions may be a powerful tool for detecting\\npresence of circadian rhythms in noisy data, even with recordings limited to 24\\nhours.', 'We establish an upper bound for the sectional genus of varieties which are\\ninvariant under Pfaff fields on projective spaces.', 'Comparison of RISC & CISC in details, encompassing the addressing modes,\\nevolution, definitions and characteristics.

Past and recent works in this field have\\nconcentrated on various languages. Arabic is one language where the scope of\\nresearch is still widespread, with it being one of the most popular languages\\nin the world and being syntactically different from other major languages. Das\\net al. \\\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-1891} has pioneered the research for\\nhandwritten digit recognition in Arabic. In this paper, we propose a novel\\nalgorithm based on deep learning neural networks using appropriate activation\\nfunction and regularization layer, which shows significantly improved accuracy\\ncompared to the existing Arabic numeral recognition methods. The proposed model\\ngives 97.4 percent accuracy, which is the recorded highest accuracy of the\\ndataset used in the experiment. We also propose a modification of the method\\ndescribed in \\\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-1891}, where our method scores\\nidentical accuracy as that of \\\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-1891}, with the\\nvalue of 93.8 percent.', 'Existing video indexing and retrieval methods on popular web-based multimedia\\nsharing websites are based on user-provided sparse tagging. This paper proposes\\na very specific way of searching for video clips, based on the content of the\\nvideo. We present our work on Content-based Video Indexing and Retrieval using\\nthe Correspondence-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (corr-LDA) probabilistic\\nframework. This is a model that provides for auto-annotation of videos in a\\ndatabase with textual descriptors, and brings the added benefit of utilizing\\nthe semantic relations between the content of the video and text. We use the\\nconcept-level matching provided by corr-LDA to build correspondences between\\ntext and multimedia, with the objective of retrieving content with increased\\naccuracy. In our experiments, we employ only the audio components of the\\nindividual recordings and compare our results with an SVM-based approach.', 'We consider supersymmetrization of Hamiltonian dynamics via antibrackets for\\nsystems whose Hamiltonian generates an isometry of the phase space.
