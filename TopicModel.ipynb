I started soliciting these items in 2017 after I saw the need\\nto help the poor and it is only now that most of the items are arriving in the\\ncountry,” he said.\\n“Is it my fault that the\\ncontainers are arriving in the country now? Is there a wrong time for one to\\nassist the poor? Whether my contract is renewed or not does not matter.”\\nHis wife said their focus\\nwas on making the flood victims happy in these distressful moments because:\\n“when one has something new, it brings a good feeling and is a psychological\\nboost in this difficult times”.\\nOne of the beneficiaries\\nMary Kunyado said she is grateful to the coach for the support.\\n“I lost most of my good\\nclothes during the floods and I am happy to have received some new clothes,”\\nshe said.\\nChikwawa district\\ncommissioner Lusizi Nhlane said 68 000 people from 15 000 families were\\naffected by the floods.

', 'Not long ago, Maxwell\\nSimba was an ordinary Kenyan boy in high school.\\nHowever, in 2017, his\\nlove for acting saw him edging hordes of other hopefuls to land a life changing\\nrole in Malawi to play William Kamkwamba in a Hollywood movie The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. \\nEarlier this year, the film’s director, Chiwetel Ejiofor, speaking to the press on the red carpet of the film’s premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, hailed Simba.\\nThe Boy Who Harnessed the Wind painted\\n“When I saw him on tape,\\nI was sort of stunned by him. He had a great minimalist quality and could\\ncommunicate all these emotions very simply, which is a technically difficult\\nthing to do. He seemed to be doing that very effortlessly,” he said.\\nAt that moment, arguably\\nmany did not agree with Ejiofor until they watched Simba’s prowess as he played William in the movie\\nwhich is an adaptation of a true-life story of Malawian United States trained\\nengineer William Kamkwamba who, through a windmill innovation, saved his Wimbe\\nVillage in Kasungu from hunger. \\nIn his debut, Simba\\nembodies the real William, with\\nstrong conviction and some poise, while Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a\\nsupporting performance of controlled power as the boy’s embattled father, Trywell.\\nSimba perfectly fitted\\nin the role of William and for those that have watched the movie will agree\\nthat, at times, the 18-year-old looked like the real William.\\nBut who is Maxwell? \\n“That’s a bit of a\\ntricky question to answer, let’s just say I love acting and music and also have\\na passion for lawn tennis,” he said in an interview.\\nWith all the stardom the\\nmovie has brought upon his once undiscovered life, Simba cherishes his role in\\nthe movie while celebrating the man who self-taught the skill of repairing\\nlocal villagers’ radios with materials he scavenged from a scrapyard.\\nReading Kamkwamba’s\\nstory through a book from which the film is adapted from was the magic that\\nSimba used to succeed as a protagonist.\\n“I didn’t know much\\nabout William’s story, but after the first audition I grabbed a copy of the\\nbook and got to learn a lot about how everything went down. I read the book\\ntwice before going on set.\\n“Other than that, I\\nobserved him from a distance when he came on set while we were still shooting\\nin Wimbe. Identifying with some of his traits like the love for electronics and\\nthe levels of curiosity also played a huge role,” said Simba.\\nAfter auditioning, Simba\\nasserts he was at ease even after knowing he will be acting in a movie together\\nwith Ejiofor and that the film is based on a true-life.\\n“I was hoping to land\\nthe role, but I was shocked and amazed at the same time. It was a lot to take\\nin. To me it was a great honour working alongside Chiwetel who is an incredible\\nactor and who has so much experience from his time in the industry,” he said.\\nOne tends to wonder how\\nit must have been taxing for the young man to do a good job as the movie’s main\\ncharacter.\\n“It was a huge\\nresponsibility. I knew I was holding a crucial card which would determine how\\nthe movie’s success would turn out,” he said, adding: “The role was not\\nchallenging, just that I knew a lot of people had high expectations and that\\nthe story had to be told in the best way like never before.”\\nThe actor rates Ejiofor\\namong the actors who inspire him.\\n“After observing his\\nwork for quite some time and just seeing the love and dedication that he puts\\ninto it, I couldn’t help but feel admiration for his work. He knows exactly what\\nhe wants and makes sure he makes it happen.\\n“I’m also inspired by\\nDwayne Johnson’s work. He makes acting seems so effortless, pulling off\\nanything that he’s required to do.

Reggae-outfit Black Missionaries, Skeffa Chimoto, Lucius Banda, Thomas Chibade and Anthony Makondetsa, to name a few, have all benefited from their association with his revered production. However, the coming of urban music producers seem to have nearly derailed his illustrious career. Our correspondent MPHATSO CHIWALA engaged Ching’amba for insights on this and other issues.\\nChing’amba: We want to get involved in daily operations of the artists\\nQ\\n: Tell us more\\nabout yourself?\\nA\\n: My name is Ralph Chin’gamba. I am 39 and I come\\nfrom Mbachundu Village, Traditional Authority Mavwere in Mchinji. I am married\\nto Chifundo Khoriyo Nkhoma and together we have five children—Sharon, Bahati,\\nEuphrasia, Alvin and Peace. I am a music producer and I own Ralph Record Studio\\nand Ralph Records Music Centre. The two fall under Ralph Records Group of\\nCompanies.\\nQ\\n: Over the years,\\nyou have been quiet with your music production. Did you quit?\\nA\\n: To be honest, I cannot completely divorce from\\nmusic. I am still passionate about music, only that due to the nature of my\\njob, I live in two countries, thus Malawi and South Africa. However, my works\\nare still on demand abroad, more especially in South Africa. The idea is to\\nassist some clients who seek my services in the rainbow nation. However, I am\\nconsidering Malawi as best place to live.\\nQ\\n: Last year, you\\ntold this publication that you were to reopen Ralph Records in Malawi, where\\nare you on that?\\nA\\n: Yes, that was the initial plan, but things\\nchanged because I had some unfinished projects in South Africa; hence, I\\nreturned to work on the same. However, I am reopening the studio this year and\\nit will be based in Area 47 in Lilongwe. For now, Copyright Association of\\nMalawi (Cosoma) has given us the licence to operate as a music distribution\\noutlet and record label to be known as Ralph Records Limited Music Centre. The\\nprincipal idea is to record and distribute music across the country. I have\\nchosen Lilongwe because it is the centre of the country and Blantyre was a bit\\nfar considering music distribution.\\nQ\\n: How do you\\nintend to go about establishing a record label?\\nA\\n: That is one of our expansion initiatives. We want\\nto get more involved in the daily operations of the artists that we will be\\nworking with by helping them in composing and recording songs and promoting\\ntheir product.\\xa0 We will employ\\nprofessionals in different areas of interest such as marketing. We want to have\\nour own studio and producers who will be working with these artists. The idea\\nis to be there from the first stage of production all the way till it is ready\\nfor consumption.\\nQ\\n: You will be\\nopening a music distribution outlet when piracy is a big issue, what is your\\nstrategy?\\nA\\n: It’s not easy, but it has to do with people’s\\nlove for their country. Piracy is a global phenomenon which has affected many\\ninstitutions. It still needs efforts from the law enforcers to instil a sense\\nof discipline among those that pirate the works of other people. But, I dream\\nbig and I am dreaming in colour.\\nQ\\n: Can we say you\\nwere overshadowed by the coming in of fresh minded urban producers who are\\nappearing suitable for the current crop of artists?\\nA\\n: Of course through the years many dynamics in the\\nindustry have changed. However, I have remained steadfast in both approach and\\noriginality and I remain one of the best producers Malawi has hatched.\\xa0 So far, I can assure you that despite that\\nthere are many big artists who come looking for my services, even in South\\nAfrica, the others are up-and-coming artists. And I am currently working on\\nRasta Wazza’s new gospel album.\\nQ\\n: You have\\nproduced music for big names in the country. Why is it that now they opt for\\nothers instead of you?\\nA\\n: I have no problem with that because I only\\nproduced their projects and never signed them. As such, they are at liberty to\\nwork with any producer of their choice. \\nQ\\n: From your\\nassessment as a long-time producer, is music in the country improving?\\nA. Think of it this way:\\nToday, everyone wants to sound like Nigerians or South Africans because it is\\nthe type of music that is enjoying massive airplay in our country. However,\\nradio stations should have some policies of controlling this. Let’s promote local\\nmaterials to meet some standards.\\nQ\\n: Are artist benefiting in the industry?\\nA\\n: It depends on what you do, but many are\\nstruggling to make ends meet. There isn’t much money in it, hence artists are\\ndoing it just for passion. However, people should start appreciating the art.\\nQ\\n: Since you came\\non the scene, what have been some of your most notable contributions to the\\nindustry?\\nA\\n: There are several achievements. I have produced\\nseveral big artists such as Lucius Banda, Wendy Harawa, Limbani Banda, Ndindi\\nMarley, Black Missionaries, Skeffa Chimoto, Charles Nsaku, Allan Ngumuya and\\nThomas Chibade.\\nQ\\n: Which urban music producers do you admire?\\nA\\n: If truth be told, Malawi has a pool of gifted\\nmusic producers, but DJ Sley and Tricky Beats have an exceptional touch.n', '\\n\\nPerhaps\\nthe allure to share the stage with some of the biggest names in the region is\\nhuge and irresistible that some local up-and-coming artists have decided to\\ncheat their way on the Nyasa Music Festival platform.\\nIn\\ntheir quest to help promote and expose young talent, organisers of the April\\n19-21 inaugural festival, Nyasa Music Group, introduced a competition where\\nup-and-coming artists were asked to submit their recorded work to stand a\\nchance of performing at the festival.\\nProcedure\\ndemanded that the top three artists, from a shortlist of 10, who will get the\\nmost comments and likes through a competition to be conducted on their Facebook\\npage will be picked.\\nQuite\\na fair chance. It is not every day that you get to rub shoulders with big names\\nin music such as Busiswa, AKA and Nasty C from South Africa and our own Gwamba,\\nFredokiss, Faith Mussa, Patience Namadingo and others. \\nThis\\nopportunity has proved to be too good to be missed by some local artists who\\nentered the competition to an extent that they have devised means to manipulate\\nthe voting system to enable themselves to get multiple auto-likes on their\\nwork. \\nIt\\nwas sad when, inside the week, the organisers announced the disqualification of\\ntwo artists answering to the names of Silk Boi and Mickie Platinums who were\\ndiscovered to be using means other than the accepted ones to get votes. \\nThe\\nNyasa Music Group meant well in creating an opportunity for the local\\nup-and-coming artists to perform on such a stage. They said they wanted to\\npromote the raw talent that is yet to receive any recognition, let alone get a\\nchance to perform at any big stage. \\nFor\\nlong, there have been cries from many young artists in the country that they\\nare left out when it comes to big events such as the Nyasa Music Festival. Here\\nwas almost a direct response to address such murmurs.\\nUnfortunately,\\ndue to so many logistical arrangements, the organisers cannot just open the\\ndoor to anyone who raises a hand expressing his/her interest to be part of the\\ncast. It was, therefore, only proper that those who felt had it, had to earn\\ntheir spot. \\nAnd\\nto erase any suspicions of favouritism and bias, the process was left in the\\nhands of the public. It is their judgement, through their votes, that would\\nearn those shortlisted a space to perform at the festival. A fair deal from\\nthis end.\\xa0 \\nIt\\nis such a shame that some in their wisdom decided to invest their efforts in\\ntrying to circumvent the process to earn themselves auto-likes. Only if they\\ncould have spared their energy in sharpening their art and skills. \\nAn\\nopportunity such as this one is not the first and last to come their way. If\\nthey were to be left out now because of lack of quality of their work,\\ncertainly after refreshing their art, someday they could have caught the\\nattention of someone. Elsewhere shortcuts have never helped anyone. More so in\\nthis field. If you do not have it in your veins, then it is not your craft. \\nAnd\\njust where is one’s pride when you cheat your way to the top when inwardly you\\nknow there were many deserving souls who did a much better job than yourself?\\nUnderstandably everyone yearns for the big opportunities but let us strive to\\nget them on merit. \\nThe\\nNyasa Music Group must be commended for doing their best in making sure the\\nprocess of choosing the top three acts is as fair as possible. And their belief\\nin promoting only those artists who are willing to put work in their craft and\\nnot shortcuts is one we should all emulate.\\xa0\\nn\\n\\n\\n', 'Group village head (GVH) Nsomba of\\nSub Traditional Authority (ST/A) Ndanga in Mulanje says courts should continue\\ngiving stiff punishments to leaders who defile children.\\nThe chief said this on Wednesday in Mulanje in reaction to March 29 sentencing of village head Makaniko to 14 years imprisonment for defiling a 12-year-old girl.\\nAn illustration of court proceedings\\nThe court heard that on February\\n16 2019 the victim was taking care of her parents’ goats in one of the forested\\nareas where the chief defiled her and warned her not to tell anyone, but her\\nmother noticed that she was struggling to walk and upon interrogation, she\\nrevealed the ordeal.\\nGVH Nsomba said the community,\\nwith knowledge communities acquired from Youth Net and Counselling (Yoneco)\\nAdolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW) project, supported by Global Fund,\\nhunted down the chief and handed him over to police. \\n“Leaders are there to protect and\\nnot abuse children; hence, stiff punishments are needed to end the\\nmalpractice,” he said. \\nMulanje district social welfare\\nofficer Jane Kajombo challenged the communities to continue exposing abusive\\nleaders. \\nOn his part, Yoneco executive\\ndirector MacBain Mkandawire commended the Judiciary for good progress in\\nhandling defilement cases.\\n“The sentence will be a lesson to\\nother leaders with similar [abusive] intentions,” he said.', 'About 21 farmer groups engaged in\\nsmall-scale agribusiness in Balaka, have received about K32 million in grants\\nto boost their businesses. \\nThe grants have been disbursed under the Village Challenge Fund (VCF) which seeks to promote the uptake of modern agriculture technologies in the district. \\nSome of the chickens reared by the farmer groups\\nSpeaking during a media tour on\\nTuesday, Balaka district agriculture development officer Dennis Zingeni said\\nthe grants are having a huge impact on the farmers’ lives in many ways. \\nHe said, “For farmers to be able\\nto use certified seed or to apply fertilisers, they need money and when they\\nare doing small-scale businesses, they become economically empowered to buy the\\ninputs.” \\nZingeni added that more farmers\\nare bound to benefit from the fund as out of 52 farmer groups who applied for\\nthe fund, 42 have qualified and will receive the second chunk of the grants. \\nOne of the beneficiary groups is\\nTithandizane Farmers Business School from Ndoya Village in Traditional\\nAuthority Msamala in the district.\\nThe group’s chairperson, Evance\\nLimbanga, said the group has been rearing an average of 100 broiler chickens on\\nfive occasions they accessed the VCF. \\n“With profits realised from the\\nsales, members have improved their economic standing in their respective\\nhomes,” he said.\\nVCF is a component of Sustainable\\nAgriculture Production Project (Sapp) which is implemented under the Ministry\\nof Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development.', 'Visual Hearing Impairment Membership Association (Vihema), a body advocating for the rights of the deafblind, special needs persons, has expressed concern over continued lack of special needs communication experts in various public institutions such as hospitals.\\nMomba facilitating a session\\nVihema project coordinator Martha\\nMomba raised the concern in Salima on Tuesday during a stakeholder consultation\\nmeeting ahead of the inception of a project aimed at enhancing inclusive sexual\\nand reproductive health services targeting deafblind females in Salima.\\nShe said such a group of people\\ndepend on a special communication method, including sign language and braile,\\nbut are denied timely and effective access to medical aid besides being\\nsubjected to situations that violate their right to privacy.\\n\\xa0\\nMomba said deafbindness is a form of\\ndisability that have been sidelined for a long time.\\n\\xa0She said: “Deafblind people face many\\ndifficulties when accessing basic social services.
